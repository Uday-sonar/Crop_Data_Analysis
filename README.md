# Crop Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves creating a dashboard to visualize crop data using various parameters such as Phosphorous, Nitrogen, Potassium, Humidity, pH of soil, Rainfall, and Temperature values. The visualization is done using PowerBI, providing insights into the relationships between these parameters and their impact on crop yield.

## Features

- **Interactive Dashboard**: Explore various parameters affecting crop yield through an interactive PowerBI dashboard.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize data trends and correlations between soil properties and environmental factors.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Analyze the impact of different parameters like Phosphorous, Nitrogen, Potassium, Humidity, pH, Rainfall, and Temperature on crop health and yield.

## Requirements

- PowerBI Desktop
- Dataset containing crop data with the following parameters: Phosphorous, Nitrogen, Potassium, Humidity, pH, Rainfall, and Temperature.

## Usage

1. Open PowerBI Desktop.

2. Load the dataset into PowerBI:
   - Click on "Get Data."
   - Select the appropriate data source and load your crop data file.

3. Use the provided PowerBI file (`crop_data_analysis.pbix`) as a template:
   - Open `crop_data_analysis.pbix` in PowerBI Desktop.
   - Replace the existing dataset with your dataset if needed.
   - Customize the visualizations as per your requirements.

4. Explore the dashboard:
   - Interact with various visualizations to gain insights into how different parameters affect crop yield.
   - Use filters and slicers to drill down into specific data points.
